In this assignment you will create a web page that demonstrates your understanding of basic JavaScript functionality. In the
previous assignment we created a registration page that a user could use to create a new account on our social networking
service. Now we create a semi-functional main page for our web application. The main page will consist of "posts" that contain
recent blob postings and picture uploads. A "post" can be an image, a block of text, or both.
