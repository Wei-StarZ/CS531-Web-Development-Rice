In this assignment you will develop the frontend design of your web application.
Our social networking web application will consist of three main views. When an un-logged-in user navigates to our site they
will be greeted with the "landing" page, where they can log in or register a new account. This page we partially developed in the
first assignment. After a user has logged in, they will be taken to the "main" page which contains the user's feed (consisting of
the most recent articles by the user and the users the current user is following), a list of the users the current user is following,
and a link to the "profile" page which allows a user to change their profile picture and other pertinent information.
